#Ansible Introduction

Ansible works by configuring client machines from an computer with Ansible components installed and configured.

#Install Ansible

$ sudo apt-get update

$ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common

$ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible

Press ENTER to accept the PPA addition.

Next, we need to refresh our system's package index so that it is aware of the packages available in the PPA. Afterwards, we can install the software:

$ sudo apt-get update

$ sudo apt-get install ansible

We now have all of the software required to administer our servers through Ansible.
