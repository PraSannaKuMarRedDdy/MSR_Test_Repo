***What is ansible-playbooks?****

It is a set of ansible playbooks showing you how to create certain full server stacks.


**Deploy the packages using Ansible**

Ansible works by configuring client machines from an computer with Ansible components installed and configured.

**Install Ansible in Ubuntu**

$ sudo apt-get update

$ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common

$ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible

Press ENTER to accept the PPA addition.

Next, we need to refresh our system's package index so that it is aware of the packages available in the PPA. Afterwards, we can install the software:

$ sudo apt-get update

$ sudo apt-get install ansible
